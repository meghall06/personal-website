# Rule #1

### No Excel shaming

---

# Goals for tonight

--

### Limitations of Excel 
- When your goal is **efficient** and **reproducible** and **shareable** analysis

--

### Advantages of R 
- (Or whatever language you like)

--

### Confidence to move on
- Find resources and develop a learning roadmap

# Data Example

## From Moneypuck

# Two questions we have from this data

--

### Longest average shifts?

- Forwards only
- Strength state: 5v4
- 100+ shifts

--

### Most shifts per game?

- Forwards vs. defensemen
- Strength state: 5v5
- 10+ games

---

# Easy enough to do in Excel!

### Longest average shifts?

- create a **shift_length** variable: `icetime / shifts`

- filter `position` to L, C, R

- filter `situation` to 5on4

- filter `shifts` to at least 100

- sort descending by `shift_length`

# Easy enough to do in Excel!

### Most shifts per game?

- create a **shifts_game** variable: `shifts / games_played`

- create a **position_grouped** variable to create D and F

- filter `situation` to 5on5

- filter `games_played` to at least 10

- find the average values for `shifts_game`

# Okay but how?

---

# Moving past Excel conceptually

--

### It is comforting to *see* all of your data

--

- but that's not really necessary!

- much more efficient to look at the pieces you need

--

### Excel quickly becomes unwieldy with too much data

- if you're working with NHL play-by-play data? 1M+ rows

--

### Easier to keep track of data frames in an R file

- rather than a lot of workbooks and sheets

--

### Separate your data from your analysis!

---

# Treat it like learning a new language

--

.pull-left[

### Excel

Create a new variable that creates **position_grouped**

]

.pull-right[

### R

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
mutate(position_grouped = 
         ifelse(position == "D",
                "D", "F"))
```

]

---

# Treat it like learning a new language


.pull-left[

### Excel

Sort descending by `shifts_game`

]

.pull-right[

### R

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
arrange(desc(shifts_game))
```
]

---

# Treat it like learning a new language

.pull-left[

### Excel

Make a pivot table by position and find average shifts

]

.pull-right[

### R

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(position_grouped) %>%
  summarize(avg_shifts_game = 
              mean(shifts_game))
```
]

---

# Treat it like learning a new language

.pull-left[

### Excel

Filter to forwards only

]

.pull-right[

### R

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
filter(position != "D")
```
