<p>When people ask me how to get into sports analytics, I always suggest starting with a question that they’re interested in exploring and using that question as a framework for learning the domain knowledge and the technical skills they need. I feel comfortable giving this advice because it’s exactly how I got into hockey analytics: I was curious about goalie pulling, and I couldn’t find enough data to satisfy my curiosity. There are plenty of articles on when teams should pull their goalies, but aside from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nhl-coaches-are-pulling-goalies-earlier-than-ever/">2015 article on FiveThirtyEight</a> by Michael Lopez and Noah Davis, I couldn’t find much data on when NHL teams were actually pulling their goalies and if game trends were catching up to the mathematical recommendations. I presented some data on the topic at the <a href="http://meghan.rbind.io/talk/seahac/">Seattle Hockey Analytics Conference</a> in March 2019, but the following analysis is broader and includes more seasons of data.</p>
