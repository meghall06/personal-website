abstract: In this workshop targeted to beginner and intermediate R users, we'll go through a sample hockey analysis question and discuss techniques from the tidyverse and beyond (including user-defined functions, RMarkdown, custom ggplot2 themes, and data manipulation with tidyr and dplyr) to learn how to level up your R programming and make your analysis more efficient and more reproducible. The slides are available at the link above and also [**here**](https://meghan.rbind.io/slides/hall_cmsac.html#1). The data is available in my `betweenthepipes` package (available on Github [**here**](https://github.com/meghall06/betweenthepipes)), and the full code for the entire workshop (including how to access the data) is available [**here**](https://github.com/meghall06/personal-website/blob/master/static/CMSAC_code.R).
