  description: |
    I love giving talks on R! I've spoken to useR groups and R-Ladies groups and given workshops at conferences. My focus is generally on some aspect(s) of the tidyverse, R Markdown, and/or ggplot. Email me if you have an opportunity you'd like to discuss.

** No content below YAML for the talk _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside talk/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
