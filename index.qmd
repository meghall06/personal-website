Hi! I am currently the technical product manager of the hockey group at [Zelus Analytics](https://zelusanalytics.com/){target="_blank"}. Prior to moving into sports analytics, I spent nearly a decade working in data management in higher education. I use & teach R, with a particular love for `ggplot2` and `quarto`.

I love helping people learn R, particularly by teaching the `tidyverse` to beginners. I've given several talks and workshops, many focused on sports analytics and all available [here](talks/index.qmd), and in summer 2021, I taught the Statistical Graphics & Visualization course through the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The course focused on data visualization using R and ggplot2, and the public-facing course website (built with `distill`) is [here](https://cmu-36315.netlify.app/){target="_blank"}.
