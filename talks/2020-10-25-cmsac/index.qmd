In this 90-minute workshop targeted to beginner and intermediate R users, weâ€™ll go through a sample hockey analysis question and discuss techniques from the `tidyverse` and beyond (including user-defined functions, RMarkdown, custom `ggplot2` themes, and data manipulation with `tidyr` and `dplyr`) to learn how to level up your R programming and make your analysis more efficient and more reproducible.

The data is available in my `betweenthepipes` package (available on Github [here](https://github.com/meghall06/betweenthepipes){style="color:#1F2041;text-decoration: underline"}), and the full code for the entire workshop (including how to access the data) is available at the link above.
