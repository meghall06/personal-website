This workshop is designed for the complete R beginner. It provides:

* a brief overview of the benefits of using R for reproducible data analysis

* the mechanics of downloading and using R

* an introduction to data manipulation and data visualization

To access the workshop materials (the two sample data sets and the code file), navigate to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/meghall06/neair){style="color:#1F2041;text-decoration: underline"}, click the big green Code button, and select "Download ZIP." Once you have R and RStudio downloaded, open the `neair.Rproj` file and you'll be all set! The slides are linked above and a PDF version is available in the repo.
